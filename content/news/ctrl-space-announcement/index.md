üõ∞ We're Launching a CTF into Space!
{{< /typeit >}}

As mhackeroni, we're excited to announce our role as challenge authors for **Ctrl+Space CTF 2025** - the first European Capture-the-Flag competition played on real satellites orbiting Earth!

This groundbreaking competition is a joint mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), D-Orbit and our team, bringing together leaders in space operations and cybersecurity to create exciting hacking challenge.

## How It Works

The competition will take place in two stages:

1. **Online Qualifiers**: September 20-21, 2025 (24-hour jeopardy-style competition)
2. **In-Orbit Finals**: November 4-6, 2025 at ESTEC, Netherlands, as part of the Security for Space Systems (3S) conference

The finals are where the real excitement begins - qualified teams will solve challenges on *actual satellites* in orbit around Earth. This represents a unique opportunity to test cybersecurity skills on space systems.

## Join the Mission

If you're a security enthusiast looking for an out-of-this-world challenge, start assembling your team now! Registration details will be announced soon.

Stay tuned for more information as we countdown to launch! üõ∞Ô∏è
